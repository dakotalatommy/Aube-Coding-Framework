### Splash Screen Diagnostics (10 tests)
| Test | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| splash-01 | Count fires on landing | Baseline measurement |

| splash-04 | Workspace entry behavior | Validate guard works |
| splash-05 | **Navigation fires** | **Shows 2x fire on route change** |
| splash-06 | SessionStorage persistence | Confirm flag prevents re-fire |
| splash-07 | Logout flag clearing | Ensure next login gets splash |

npx playwright test --project=iphone

# Tablet (768x1024)
npx playwright test --project=tablet
```

### Interactive/Debug Mode
```bash
# UI mode (recommended for first run)
npx playwright test --ui

# Headed browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test --debug splash-03
```

## 📊 Expected Output

### Console Output Example
```
=== SPLASH LOG ANALYSIS ===
Total console logs: 127
Splash-related logs: 15
Splash fires: 4

Splash events:
  [2025-09-30T12:34:56.789Z] [splash] initializing {showSplash: false}
  [2025-09-30T12:34:57.123Z] [splash] enable (auth-callback)
  [2025-09-30T12:34:57.456Z] [splash] enable (bootstrap)
  [2025-09-30T12:34:58.789Z] [splash] showSplash=true
  [2025-09-30T12:34:59.012Z] [splash] hasBooted=true
===========================

🔍 Landing page splash fires: 1 ✅
🔍 Sign-in click splash fires: 1 ⚠️
🔍 Auth callback splash fires: 2 ❌
🔍 Navigation splash fires: 4 ❌
```

### Test Results
```
Running 90 tests using 1 worker

✅ splash-01: Landing page load - count splash fires (1.2s)
✅ splash-02: Sign-in click - track splash on button click (0.8s)
❌ splash-03: Auth callback - monitor double-enable (1.5s)
  Expected 1 splash fire, got 2
✅ splash-04: Workspace entry - verify splash behavior (1.1s)
❌ splash-05: Navigation between panes - check if splash fires (2.3s)
  Expected 0 splash fires, got 4

...

90 passed (85.3s)
```

## 🐛 What the Tests Will Reveal

### Splash Issue Root Cause
The tests will prove your analysis:

> "The guard isn't hydrated before the auth-callback branch runs. When Supabase redirects back to /auth/callback, the listener fires immediately with newSession, and we call maybeEnableSplash('auth-callback'). At that moment we still have the default hasShownSplash.current === false."

**Test Evidence:**
1. **splash-03** will show auth callback fires before guard loads
2. **splash-05** will show navigation triggers double enable
3. **splash-06** will confirm guard works ONLY when loaded first
4. **splash-08** will capture exact timing of white screen

### Other Issues to Surface
- Elements loaded but not interactable (pointer-events)
- Network calls complete but UI blocked
- SessionStorage timing issues
- Route change performance bottlenecks

## 🔧 Test Infrastructure

### Helper Functions
```typescript
// From test-config.ts
TestHelpers.filterSplashLogs(logs)      // Extract splash events
TestHelpers.countSplashFires(logs)      // Count enable calls
TestHelpers.getSessionStorage(page, key) // Read storage
TestHelpers.isInteractable(page, sel)   // Check clickability
TestHelpers.screenshot(page, name)       // Capture state
```

### Configuration
- **Timeouts:** 30s default, 60s for AI APIs
- **Viewports:** Laptop, iPhone, Tablet
- **Retries:** 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Parallel:** Sequential (for splash debugging)

- [ ] Search/filter functionality complete
- [ ] Mobile responsive polished
