## 🐛 What the Tests Will Prove

### Your Root Cause Analysis
> "The guard isn't hydrated before the auth-callback branch runs. When Supabase redirects back to /auth/callback, the listener fires immediately with newSession, and we call maybeEnableSplash('auth-callback'). At that moment we still have the default hasShownSplash.current === false."

**Test Evidence:**
1. **splash-03** will show auth callback fires BEFORE guard loads ✅
2. **splash-05** will show navigation triggers double enable ✅
3. **splash-06** will confirm guard works ONLY when loaded first ✅
4. **splash-08** will capture exact timing of white screen ✅
5. **splash-09** will provide complete timeline with millisecond precision ✅

### Issues to Surface
- ❌ Double splash enable on auth callback
- ❌ Splash firing 2x on navigation
- ❌ White screen while elements loaded
- ❌ Elements present but not interactable
- ⚠️ SessionStorage guard timing

## 🎯 Launch Readiness Checklist

### Critical (Must Pass)
- [ ] Splash fires only 1x per session
- [ ] No white screen on navigation
- [ ] Auth flows work (Google + Email)
- [ ] All routes load successfully
- [ ] Ask VX chat responds
- [ ] No vertical scroll (per design)
- [ ] Elements are interactable

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix double splash enable on auth callback
- [ ] Fix splash firing 2x on navigation
- [ ] Hydrate guard before auth listener
- [ ] Resolve interaction blocking

### Run Checklist
```bash
# 1. Run splash diagnostics
npx playwright test splash/ --project=laptop-chrome

# 2. Review console output & screenshots
# 3. Fix identified issues
# 4. Run full suite
npx playwright test

# 5. Generate report
npx playwright show-report
