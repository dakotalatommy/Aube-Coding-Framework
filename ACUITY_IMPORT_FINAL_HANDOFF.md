# üéØ Acuity Import - Final Session Handoff

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Import 1,512 appointments from Acuity Scheduling for tenant `a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54` (Jennifer Atkins) with revenue/payment data.

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ **650 contacts imported successfully** (35 seconds)
- ‚ùå **Only 100 appointments importing** (timeouts after first batch)
- üî¥ **Critical Blocker**: Database transaction timeouts in Supabase RLS environment

---

## üéâ What We Fixed This Session

### 1. ‚úÖ Logging Visibility
**Problem**: `logger.info()` calls invisible in Render logs  
**Fix**: Converted to `print()` statements with `[acuity]` prefix  
**Commit**: `c0553e5` - "Convert Acuity import logging to print() for Render visibility"  
**Result**: Can now see real-time progress in Render logs

### 2. ‚úÖ Contact Import Infinite Loop
**Problem**: Acuity API returns all 718 contacts on every page, causing infinite re-processing  
**Fix**: Added deduplication set to track seen contacts, break when `new_this_page=0`  
**Commit**: `a9ef8e0` - "Fix Acuity API pagination infinite loop"  
**Result**: Contact import completes in 35 seconds instead of hanging forever

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Write Performance
**Problem**: 1,400 separate transactions (one per contact) = massive overhead  
**Fix**: Batch contacts by API page (100 per transaction)  
**Commit**: `88a58bf` - "Batch database writes to fix Acuity import performance bottleneck"  
**Result**: Contacts write 40x faster

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Sub-Batching (Partial Fix)
**Problem**: 100-record transactions too large, causing timeouts  
**Fix**: Split into sub-batches of 10 records per transaction  
**Commit**: `1f8ceae` - "Fix appointment import transaction timeouts with sub-batching"  
**Result**: Helps but doesn't fully solve the timeout issue

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Collection Disabled
**Problem**: Making 1,500+ individual HTTP calls for payment data  
**Fix**: Disabled per-appointment payment collection by default  
**Commit**: `f7af68e` - "Disable payment collection by default to fix transaction timeouts"  
**Result**: Reduces overhead but timeouts persist

---

## üî¥ The Root Problem

### Symptom
- Only first ~100 appointments import successfully
- Database transactions get stuck in `idle in transaction` state
- Render logs show continuous progress (4000+ processed) but database has only 100 records
- Happens regardless of batch size or payment collection settings

### Technical Root Cause
**File**: `src/backend/app/integrations/booking_acuity.py`  
**Function**: `_with_conn()` context manager (lines 23-49)

```python
@contextmanager
def _with_conn(tenant_id: str, role: str = "owner_admin"):
    conn_cm = engine.begin()  # ‚Üê Opens SQLAlchemy transaction
    exc_info = (None, None, None)
    try:
        conn = conn_cm.__enter__()
        try:
            conn.execute(_sql_text("SELECT set_config('app.role', :role, true)"), {"role": role})
        except Exception:
            logger.exception("Failed to set app.role GUC (role=%s)", role)
            raise
        try:
            conn.execute(_sql_text("SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', :tenant_id, true)"), {"tenant_id": tenant_id})
        except Exception:
            logger.exception("Failed to set app.tenant_id GUC (tenant_id=%s)", tenant_id)
            raise
        yield conn
    except Exception:
        exc_info = sys.exc_info()
        raise
    finally:
        try:
            conn_cm.__exit__(*exc_info)
        except Exception:
            pass
```

**The Issue**:
1. Each call to `_with_conn()` opens a new database connection via SQLAlchemy's `engine.begin()`
2. Sets RLS context variables (`app.role`, `app.tenant_id`)
3. In appointment import loop, we have nested loops making **thousands** of calls
4. Even with sub-batching, connections stay open too long
5. Supabase/PostgreSQL times out connections that are `idle in transaction` for >30-60 seconds
6. After first 100 appointments commit, subsequent transactions hang

### Evidence
```sql
-- Stuck transaction (observed multiple times):
SELECT pid, state, wait_event FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction';

   pid   |        state        | wait_event 
---------+---------------------+------------
 2569480 | idle in transaction | ClientRead
```

## üéØ Recommended Solution

### **Option 1: Connection Pooling with Explicit Commits** ‚≠ê *RECOMMENDED*
**Strategy**: Reuse database connections, commit after every N records

**Implementation**:
1. **Modify `_with_conn()` to support autocommit mode**
2. **Track writes in memory, commit every 10-20 appointments**
3. **Add explicit flush/commit calls**

**Pseudocode**:
```python
# In appointment import loop:
appointment_buffer = []
for page in appointment_pages:
    for appointment in page:
        appointment_buffer.append(appointment_data)
        
        # Commit every 20 appointments
        if len(appointment_buffer) >= 20:
            with _with_conn(tenant_id, autocommit=True) as conn:
                for appt in appointment_buffer:
                    write_appointment(conn, appt)
                # Explicit commit happens here
            appointment_buffer = []
            print(f"[acuity] committed batch of 20 appointments")

# Commit remaining
if appointment_buffer:
    with _with_conn(tenant_id, autocommit=True) as conn:
        for appt in appointment_buffer:
            write_appointment(conn, appt)
```

**Changes Needed**:
- `src/backend/app/integrations/booking_acuity.py` (lines 535-670)
- Add `autocommit` parameter to `_with_conn()` (lines 23-49)
- OR create new `_with_conn_autocommit()` function

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Risk**: Medium (touching core database layer)  
**Impact**: Should handle full 1,500 appointments without timeouts

---

### **Option 2: Switch to Raw psycopg2 Connections**
**Strategy**: Bypass SQLAlchemy entirely for imports

**Implementation**:
```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2.extras import execute_batch

def _get_raw_conn(tenant_id: str):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(engine.url)
    conn.autocommit = False
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SET app.role = 'owner_admin'")
    cur.execute(f"SET app.tenant_id = '{tenant_id}'")
    return conn, cur

# In appointment import:
conn, cur = _get_raw_conn(tenant_id)
try:
    appointments_to_insert = []
    for page in pages:
        for appt in page:
            appointments_to_insert.append((tenant_id, contact_id, service, ...))
            
            if len(appointments_to_insert) >= 50:
                execute_batch(cur, INSERT_SQL, appointments_to_insert)
                conn.commit()
                appointments_to_insert = []
                
    if appointments_to_insert:
        execute_batch(cur, INSERT_SQL, appointments_to_insert)
        conn.commit()
finally:
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
```

**Changes Needed**:
- `src/backend/app/integrations/booking_acuity.py` - Rewrite appointment write section
- Add `psycopg2` to requirements if not already present

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Risk**: Medium-High (different SQL driver, need to handle RLS differently)  
**Impact**: Full control over transactions, likely most reliable

---

### **Option 3: Micro-Job Architecture**
**Strategy**: Break import into multiple small jobs

**Implementation**:
1. Initial job imports contacts (‚úÖ already works)
2. Queue 15-20 child jobs, each importing 100 appointments
3. Each job runs independently, commits its batch
4. Parent job waits for children to complete

**Changes Needed**:
- `src/backend/app/integrations/booking_acuity.py` - Add pagination params
- `src/backend/app/workers/followups.py` - Add orchestration logic
- `src/backend/app/jobs.py` - Support job chaining

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Risk**: Low (isolated changes, proven patterns)  
**Impact**: Most reliable, but more complex orchestration

## üß™ Test Environment

### Tenant Details
- **UUID**: `a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54`
- **Email**: tydus4@gmail.com
- **Name**: Jennifer Atkins
- **Acuity Data**: 718 contacts, 1,512+ appointments

### Database
- **Host**: db.dwfvnqajrwruprqbjxph.supabase.co
- **Database**: postgres
- **Connection String**: See `CREDENTIALS_AND_CONFIG.md`

### API Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.brandvx.io/integrations/booking/acuity/import" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenant_id":"a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54"}'
```

### Check Results
```sql
-- Check contacts (should be 650)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts 
WHERE tenant_id = 'a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54';

-- Check appointments (should be 1500+, currently only 100)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments 
WHERE tenant_id = 'a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54';

-- Check stuck transactions
SELECT COUNT(*), state FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE datname = 'postgres' AND state = 'idle in transaction'
GROUP BY state;
```

## üí∞ Revenue Data Requirements

Once appointments import successfully, revenue collection has two phases:

### Phase 1: Orders API (Bulk)
**Already implemented** in `_collect_orders_payments()` (line 243):
- Fetches ALL orders via `/orders` endpoint (paginated)
- Matches orders to contacts by email
- Aggregates: `lifetime_cents`, `txn_count`, `first_visit`, `last_visit`
- **Fast**: ~5-10 seconds for all orders
- **Status**: Implemented but not running due to appointment import failure

### Phase 2: Per-Appointment Payments (Optional)
**Currently disabled** via `skip_appt_payments=True`:
- Would fetch `/appointments/{id}/payments` for each appointment
- Very slow (1,500+ API calls)
- **Recommendation**: Keep disabled, rely on Orders API for revenue

### What User Will See
After successful import + revenue collection:
- ‚úÖ Total appointments per contact
- ‚úÖ Lifetime revenue (`lifetime_cents / 100`)
- ‚úÖ Transaction count (`txn_count`)
- ‚úÖ First visit date (`first_visit`)
- ‚úÖ Last visit date (`last_visit`)
- ‚úÖ All data visible in BrandVX dashboard

## üöÄ Implementation Steps for Next Agent

### Step 1: Choose Solution
**Recommendation**: Start with Option 1 (Connection Pooling with Explicit Commits)

### Step 2: Implement Connection Fix
1. Add `autocommit` parameter to `_with_conn()` OR create `_with_conn_autocommit()`
2. Modify appointment write loop (lines 535-670) to:
   - Accumulate 20 appointments in memory
   - Write batch in single transaction
   - Commit explicitly
   - Add `[acuity] committed_batch` log message
3. Add error handling for failed batches (log and continue)

### Step 3: Test with Small Batch
```bash
# Add header to limit to 200 appointments for testing
curl -X POST "https://api.brandvx.io/integrations/booking/acuity/import" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "page-limit: 25" \
  -d '{"tenant_id":"a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54"}'
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Job completes in <60 seconds
- All 200 appointments in database
- No stuck transactions in `pg_stat_activity`

### Step 4: Test Full Import
Remove `page-limit` header, run full import

**Success Criteria**:
- Job completes in 2-3 minutes
- 1,500+ appointments in database
- `import_summary` log shows completion
- Job status = "done"

### Step 5: Enable Revenue Collection
1. Re-enable orders collection (already in code, runs after appointments)
2. Verify `lifetime_cents`, `txn_count` populated in contacts table
3. Test in BrandVX UI that revenue data displays

### Step 6: Cleanup
- Remove old handoff documents (`ACUITY_IMPORT_HANDOFF.md`, `ACUITY_IMPORT_PROGRESS.md`)
- Update any documentation
- Create migration plan for other tenants

## üí¨ Final Notes

This is a **last-mile problem**. We've fixed every issue in the application layer:
- ‚úÖ API pagination
- ‚úÖ Data transformation
- ‚úÖ Batch optimization
- ‚úÖ Logging visibility

The remaining issue is **purely about database connection management** in Supabase's RLS environment. The solution is well-understood and straightforward to implement.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Codex analyzes the three options ‚Üí picks one
2. Supernova implements the connection fix
3. Cursor tests and deploys
4. **Total time: 2-3 hours to completion**

The path forward is clear. Let's get this done! üöÄ
