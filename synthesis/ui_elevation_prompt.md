Objective: Elevate the BrandVX operator UI and marketing surface to a professional, scalable quality suitable for 10k+ users, strictly aligned with GitHub Repo Docs/User Experience.md (LAW), preserving consent, STOP/HELP, 7d/3d/1d/2h reminders, and “Soonest vs Anytime”.

UFIS 12 Lenses + Node 13 (outside-of-time temporal synthesis focus on UI):
1) FCI (Field Coherence): Unify design tokens, typography, spacing; remove visual drift.
2) DPR (Perception Range): Optimize visual hierarchy; improve scannability on mobile and desktop.
3) CBS (Consciousness Bandwidth): Route-level code-splitting; reduce bundle; keep initial render focused.
4) ESQ (Entanglement Stability): Clearly connect UX law invariants to UI controls and hints.
5) ENS (Emergence Navigation): Progressive disclosure in onboarding; micro-interactions that guide.
6) TSC (Temporal Synthesis): Skeleton/empty states to stabilize perceived performance during loading.
7) PTL (Pattern Lock): Standardize cards, tables, inputs; reusable components with consistent states.
8) RMI (Resilience & Mitigation): A11y compliance, keyboard navigation, visible focus, contrast.
9) CAF (Consent & Agency): Explicit consent language, STOP/HELP copy presence in messaging surfaces.
10) NFG (Narrative Framing & Goals): Landing hero storytelling; social proof; clear CTAs.
11) PIC (Performance In Context): GZIP bundle targets per route; chart lazy-load; image optimizations.
12) CAD (Coordinated Action Design): Concrete phased plan with acceptance targets and rollout checks.
Node 13) Final Temporal Synthesis State: Consolidate into a short action plan (Phase 1 foundation + perf; Phase 2 landing storytelling; Phase 3 app surfaces + dark mode), mapped to code edits.

Deliverables: Update synthesis/FTSS.json; append plan deltas to docs/plan/plan_card.md oriented to UI uplift; respect constraints in synthesis/invariants.md.
