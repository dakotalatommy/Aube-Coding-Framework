These rules are hard constraints for planning and code changes.

- ○ “Soonest vs Anytime” preference defaults.
- ● **Meeting booked** → reminders: **7d / 3d / 1d / 2h**.
- ○ BrandVX asks “**Soonest vs Anytime**”.
- **≥5 referrals**, they’re flagged as **Ambassador Candidate**.
- ● **Ambassador Candidates**: those meeting the thresholds \(with contact links\)
- ● **Cadence Queue**: next 50 scheduled sends \(who, channel, bucket.tag, when\)
- ● **STOP/HELP** always works; BrandVX records consent and backs off immediately.
- ● One attempt per step; reply instantly re-routes the contact to Engaged.
- ● “Soonest vs Anytime” is asked at the right moments.
- ● Cadence Queue is accurate and actionable.
- STOP/HELP always works; suppression immediate; evidence auditable.
- One attempt per cadence step; reply re-routes state; apply rate limits.
- Booking reminders: 7d / 3d / 1d / 2h schedule.
- Ask and store Soonest vs Anytime; notify-list triggers on cancellation.
- Time Saved = baseline - automation; milestones 10h/25h/50h/100h.
- Ambassador Candidate when revenue uplift + usage + referrals thresholds hit.
- Maintain accurate Cadence Queue and Dashboard KPIs.
- If SMS fails, email fallback (when consented); strict webhook signature verification.
