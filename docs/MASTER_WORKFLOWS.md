# BrandVX Master Workflow List

Canonical, user-facing workflows BrandVX supports. Each item should be discoverable via the Workflows page, AskVX, and page-level “Guide me” tours. Copy is non-technical and aligned to UX LAW.

## Onboarding (Finish all touchpoints)
- Connect accounts: Google (Calendar), Apple (ICS), Square, Acuity, HubSpot, Facebook, Instagram, Shopify
- Run analysis: connected map, readiness, reconciliation (contacts vs booking)
- Brand profile: tagline, voice, specialties; save to settings
- Consent & timing preview: 7d / 3d / 1d / 2h defaults; Soonest vs Anytime selector
- Progress UX: Next / Back; 100% completion indicator

## Messaging & Cadences
- Start a cadence for a contact or segment (consent-first)
- Simulate message; send with approvals and quiet-hours
- STOP/HELP handling; rate limiting and audit

## Calendar (Unified)
- Sync Google and Apple; merge bookings from Square/Acuity
- View unified events; provider filter; last-sync badges

## Inventory
- Sync Shopify/Square; manual recompute
- Review items (SKU, stock, cost, price) and low/out-of-stock

## Inbox (Master)
- Connect Facebook/Instagram; show readiness and badges
- Filter by channel; review new DMs/comments/emails/texts

## Client Import & Curation
- Import contacts (CSV or integrations)
- “Hire/Fire” curation: swipe/drag Keep or Discard; stats

## Approvals
- Review pending approvals; approve/reject
- Inline banners on risky actions with direct links

## Analytics & KPIs
- Dashboard KPIs: time saved, messages sent, funnel series
- Exports: contacts; metrics endpoints

## Reconciliation
- Surface booking vs contacts mismatches; fix actions

## Settings, Security, Compliance
- Tone, services, auto-approve toggle
- Quiet-hours per tenant
- Admin vs public login; HIPAA exploration (advisory only)

## AskVX Guidance (Floating)
- Docable AskVX: floating/dockable window
- Session persistence (30 days); action logs; “Get Started!” buttons

Notes:
- All workflows must be launchable from: Workflows page, AskVX buttons, or page-level “Guide me”.
- Copy must be consent-first, simple, and non-technical.
