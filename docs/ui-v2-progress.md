# UI V2 Migration Progress

_Last updated: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')_

## Status Redacted Pending Re-Evaluation

The detailed progress list in this file is outdated relative to the current codebase. We are preparing a comprehensive re-audit of the UI V2 implementation (2025-09) to validate:

- Which modules actually achieve parity with the legacy workspace.
- Which backend endpoints are surfaced through the new UI.
- Which features remain partially implemented or regressed.

Until that audit is complete, consider all sections below as placeholders. Do **not** rely on the previous “Completed / Backlog” bullets—they predate the latest migration work and may contradict production behaviour.

## Next Steps

- See `docs/ui-v2-execution-plan.md`, `docs/ui-v2-feature-map.md`, and the upcoming `ui-v2-reaudit-2025.md` (to be created) for the current action plan.
- Once the review concludes, rewrite this file with the verified module checklist, execution status, and remaining tasks.
