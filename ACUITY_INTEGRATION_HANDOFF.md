# Acuity Integration: Comprehensive Handoff Document

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Tenant**: Jennifer Atkins (Test Account)  
**Tenant UUID**: `a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54`  
**Status**: Date attribution fix deployed, contact rollup correction needed

---

## Executive Summary

We successfully fixed a critical date attribution bug in the Acuity integration where transactions were being recorded with payment dates instead of appointment dates. This caused revenue to be misreported - payments made in October for November appointments were counted in October's revenue, and vice versa.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Code fix deployed and working (transactions now use appointment dates)
- ✅ 171 clean transactions imported ($13,610.50 total revenue)
- ✅ Payment dates preserved in metadata for future cash flow analysis
- ❌ Contact lifetime values are over-counted by ~17-20x due to overlapping backfill runs
- ⏳ Need to reset and recalculate contact rollups from transactions table

---

## Original Problem

### The Issue
BrandVX dashboard showed $682 revenue for October 2025, but Acuity reports showed ~$10,000-$11,000. The client (Jennifer Atkins) expected to see revenue matching Acuity's reports.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Date Misattribution** (PRIMARY ISSUE - NOW FIXED)
   - Transactions were dated by `payment.get("created")` (when payment was made)
   - Should have been dated by `appointment.get("datetime")` (when service was scheduled)
   - This caused pre-paid appointments to be counted in the wrong month
   - Example: Payment made Sept 30 for Oct 15 appointment → counted in September instead of October

2. **Missing Cash Payments** (FIXED)
   - Acuity API returns cash payments with `processor: "cash"`
   - Code was checking `paymentType` or `paymentMethod` fields, missing the `processor` field
   - This caused all cash/offline payments to be missed or marked as "appointment"

3. **Job Hanging** (FIXED)
   - Original rollup logic updated contacts one-by-one in a loop
   - For large datasets (1000+ contacts), this caused 15+ minute timeouts
   - Fixed by batching contact updates (100 per batch)

4. **Contact Rollup Over-counting** (CURRENT ISSUE - NOT YET FIXED)
   - The rollup logic uses additive updates: `lifetime_cents = COALESCE(lifetime_cents, 0) + :cents`
   - We ran 5 overlapping backfills during testing/deployment
   - Each backfill ADDED to existing lifetime_cents even though transactions weren't duplicated (due to `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
   - Result: Contact lifetime values are ~17.6x over-counted

## Changes Implemented

### Code Changes (Deployed)

**File**: `src/backend/app/integrations/booking_acuity.py`

#### 1. Function Signature Update (Line 224-235)
Added `appointment_date` parameter to `_collect_appointment_payments`:

```python
def _collect_appointment_payments(
    ledger: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    contact_id: str,
    client: httpx.Client,
    base: str,
    appointment_id: str,
    *,
    appointment_date: Optional[int] = None,  # NEW: epoch timestamp of appointment
    tenant_id: Optional[str] = None,
    conn = None,
    payment_records: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
) -> Dict[str, int]:
```

#### 2. Transaction Date Logic (Lines 298-318)
Changed to use appointment date as primary transaction date:

```python
# Use appointment date as transaction date (when service occurs)
# Store payment date in metadata for cash flow tracking
payment_created = payment.get("created") or payment.get("paidDate") or payment.get("datePaid")
transaction_date = None
if appointment_date:
    # Convert epoch to ISO timestamp for Postgres
    from datetime import datetime
    transaction_date = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(appointment_date).isoformat()
else:
    # Fallback to payment date if appointment date not available
    transaction_date = payment_created

external_ref = transaction_id or f"acuity_appt_payment_{appointment_id}_{created_ts or int(time.time())}"
payment_method = payment.get("processor") or payment.get("paymentType") or payment.get("paymentMethod") or "appointment"

# Log date attribution for first few transactions
if metrics["payments_processed"] < 3:
    print(
        f"[acuity] DATE_ATTRIBUTION: aid={appointment_id}, "
        f"appointment_date={transaction_date}, payment_date={payment_created}"
    )
```

#### 3. Metadata Enhancement (Lines 331-339)
Now stores both appointment and payment dates:

```python
"meta": json.dumps(
    {
        "appointment_id": appointment_id,
        "payment_method": payment_method,
        "transaction_id": transaction_id,
        "payment_date": payment_created,  # NEW: original payment date
        "appointment_date": transaction_date,  # NEW: for reference
    }
),
```

#### 4. Transaction Insert Update (Line 329)
Uses the computed transaction_date:

```python
"tdate": transaction_date or payment_created or None,
```

#### 5. Call Site Update (Lines 1042-1052)
Passes appointment date to payment collection:

```python
appt_metrics = _collect_appointment_payments(
    payments_map,
    appt_data["contact_id"],
    client,
    base,
    appt_data["appointment_id"],
    appointment_date=appt_data.get("start_ts"),  # NEW: pass appointment date
    tenant_id=tenant_id,
    conn=conn,
    payment_records=payment_records,
)
```

### Git Commits

## Current Database State

### Transactions Table
```sql
-- Total transactions: 171
-- Total revenue: $13,610.50
-- Date range: 2024-09-02 to 2025-10-21
```

**Breakdown by Year**:
| Year | Transactions | Revenue |
|------|--------------|---------|
| 2024 | 109 | $9,135.50 |
| 2025 | 62 | $4,475.00 |

**Payment Methods**:
| Method | Count | Revenue |
|--------|-------|---------|
| cash | 99 | $9,253.00 |
| stripe | 44 | $3,180.75 |
| appointment | 22 | $858.00 |
| paypal | 4 | $168.75 |
| unknown | 2 | $150.00 |

**October 2025 Specific**:
- Transactions: 52
- Revenue: $3,958.00
- Note: Only 52 of 95 October appointments have payments (others haven't occurred or been paid yet, as today is Oct 22)

### Appointments Table
```sql
-- Total appointments: 344
-- Date range: 2024-10-11 to 2026-05-27 (includes future appointments)
-- October 2025: 95 appointments
```

### Contacts Table (⚠️ DATA ISSUE)
```sql
-- Total contacts: 654
-- Contacts with revenue: 156
-- Sum of lifetime_cents: $270,018.75 ❌ INCORRECT
-- Sum of txn_count: 3,018 ❌ INCORRECT
```

**Expected values**:
- Sum of lifetime_cents: $13,610.50 (matching transactions)
- Sum of txn_count: 171 (matching transactions)

**Current over-count**: ~17.6x (3,018 / 171)

---

## Current Issues

### CRITICAL: Contact Rollup Over-Counting

**Problem**: Contact `lifetime_cents` and `txn_count` are massively over-counted due to overlapping backfill runs.

**Root Cause**: 
The rollup logic in `booking_acuity.py` lines 1194-1195 uses additive updates:
```python
"txn_count = COALESCE(txn_count,0) + :cnt, "
"lifetime_cents = COALESCE(lifetime_cents,0) + :cents, "
```

When we ran 5 overlapping backfills:
- Transactions table: Protected by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` → No duplicates ✅
- Contacts rollup: Uses `+=` logic → Each run ADDED to existing values ❌

**Impact**:
- Top client shows $14,700 lifetime value (should be much less)
- Total across all contacts: $270,018.75 (should be $13,610.50)
- Transaction counts: 3,018 total (should be 171)

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Reset all contacts to zero
2. Recalculate from transactions table (source of truth)

```sql
-- Step 1: Reset
UPDATE contacts 
SET lifetime_cents = 0, txn_count = 0, first_visit = NULL, last_visit = NULL
WHERE tenant_id = 'a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54';

-- Step 2: Recalculate from transactions
UPDATE contacts c
SET 
  lifetime_cents = COALESCE(t.total_cents, 0),
  txn_count = COALESCE(t.txn_count, 0),
  updated_at = NOW()
FROM (
  SELECT 
    contact_id,
    SUM(amount_cents) as total_cents,
    COUNT(*) as txn_count
  FROM transactions
  WHERE tenant_id = 'a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54'
    AND source = 'acuity'
  GROUP BY contact_id
) t
WHERE c.contact_id = t.contact_id
  AND c.tenant_id = 'a8d9029d-dbbb-4b8f-bc33-161e40a1ff54';
```

### MINOR: October 2025 Revenue Lower Than Expected

**Observed**: 52 transactions = $3,958 for October 2025  
**Expected** (from user): 113 transactions = ~$11,059

**Explanation**: This is NOT a bug. The discrepancy is because:
1. Today is October 22, 2025
2. We have 95 October appointments total
3. Only 52 have payment records (appointments that have occurred and been paid)
4. The remaining 43 appointments are either:
   - Future appointments (Oct 23-31) that haven't occurred yet
   - Recent appointments that haven't been paid yet
   - Unpaid/cancelled appointments

**Validation**: This is expected behavior. As more October appointments occur and get paid, the numbers will naturally increase.

## Data Verification Examples

### Example: Date Attribution Working Correctly

Sample transactions showing appointment date vs payment date:

```
txn_date   | payment_date         | appt_date           | amount | method
-----------|----------------------|---------------------|--------|--------
2024-12-29 | 2024-12-26T01:36:29  | 2024-12-29T21:00:00 | $12.00 | stripe
2024-12-29 | 2024-12-19T11:00:59  | 2024-12-29T17:10:00 | $27.00 | stripe
```

✅ The transaction is dated by appointment (Dec 29), even though payment was made earlier (Dec 26, Dec 19).

### Example: Cash Payments Captured

Before the fix, cash payments were missed. Now they're the majority:
- Cash: 99 transactions ($9,253)
- Stripe: 44 transactions ($3,180.75)

✅ Cash payments are now properly captured with `processor: "cash"`.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Fix Contact Rollups**
   - Reset all contacts' lifetime_cents and txn_count to 0
   - Recalculate from transactions table
   - Verify totals match (should be $13,610.50)
   - See SQL in "Current Issues" section above

### Short-term
2. **Prevent Future Over-counting**
   - Consider changing rollup logic from additive (`+=`) to calculated (always SUM from transactions)
   - Or add safeguards to detect duplicate backfill runs
   - Document that overlapping backfills should be avoided

3. **Historical Data Gap**
   - Current data only goes back to Sept 2, 2024
   - Acuity account has appointments from June 20, 2023
   - Consider whether full historical import is needed (would add ~1.5 years of data)
   - Client may want complete lifetime revenue data

### Long-term
4. **Revenue Segmentation**
   - Now that we have both appointment_date and payment_date, can segment:
     - Revenue by service date (current implementation)
     - Cash flow by payment date (future feature)
     - Pre-paid appointments (payment_date < appointment_date)

5. **Square Integration**
   - User mentioned moving to Square eventually
   - Similar date attribution logic will be needed
   - Use this Acuity work as a template

## Key Learnings

1. **Always use appointment/service date for revenue attribution**, not payment date
   - Payment date is useful for cash flow analysis but shouldn't be the primary transaction date
   
2. **Acuity API quirks**:
   - Cash payments use `processor: "cash"`, not `paymentType`
   - Multiple payment-related endpoints: `/appointments/{id}/payments` and `/orders`
   - Appointments API has multiple pagination strategies

3. **Idempotency is critical**:
   - Transaction inserts are protected by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` ✅
   - But rollup logic is additive - not protected from duplicate runs ❌
   - Always consider what happens if a job runs twice

4. **Batch processing matters**:
   - Updating 1000+ contacts one-by-one causes timeouts
   - Processing in batches (100 at a time) solved this
   - For very large tenants, may need even larger batches or different approach

5. **Test incrementally**:
   - Single day → week → month → year → comprehensive
   - Catch issues early before processing huge datasets
   - Monitor job duration to catch performance problems
