# Acuity Payment Gap Fix - Status Report
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Implementation**: Complete  
**Results**: Significant Progress (44% → 54% capture rate)

## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed critical issues and improved October 2025 revenue capture from **$338 (3%)** to **$4,826 (44%)**.

### Key Achievements
✅ **Job hanging fixed** - Batched contact rollup prevents timeouts  
✅ **Cash payments captured** - 34 cash transactions ($3,009) now working  
✅ **Payment method field fixed** - Using `processor` correctly identifies payment types  
✅ **Enhanced logging** - Comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting  
✅ **Contact rollups working** - 122 contacts with $76,793 lifetime value updated  

### Remaining Gap
- **Appointments**: 95 of 230 (41% capture)
- **Transactions**: 72 of 133 (54% capture)
- **Revenue**: $4,826 of $11,059 (44% capture)
- **Missing**: 135 appointments, ~$6,200 revenue

## Detailed Results

### Before Fix (Initial State)
- 9 transactions: $338
- Only 68 October appointments
- Payment method: All marked as "appointment"
- Jobs hanging during contact rollup
- Zero cash payments captured

### After Fix (Current State)
| Metric | Count | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash** | 34 | $3,009 |
| **Stripe** | 14 | $809 |
| **Appointment** | 22 | $858 |
| **Unknown** | 2 | $150 |
| **TOTAL** | **72** | **$4,826** |

### October Appointments
- Captured: 95 appointments
- Expected: 230 appointments (from Acuity API)
- Gap: 135 appointments (59%)

### Target vs Actual
| Metric | Target | Actual | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| Appointments | 230 | 95 | 41% |
| Transactions | 133 | 72 | 54% |
| Revenue | $11,059 | $4,826 | 44% |

## Code Changes Implemented

### 1. Batched Contact Rollup (Lines 1101-1162)
**Problem**: Single-transaction rollup caused job hanging with 1000+ contacts  
**Solution**: Process contacts in batches of 100 with committed transactions  
**Result**: Jobs complete successfully without timeout

```python
# Process contacts in batches of 100 to avoid hanging
contact_items = list(payments_map.items())
batch_size = 100
total_batches = (len(contact_items) + batch_size - 1) // batch_size

for batch_num in range(total_batches):
    with _with_conn(tenant_id) as conn:
        # Process batch
        # Commit happens at end of with block
```

### 2. Payment Method Field Fix (Line 299)
**Problem**: Code looked for `paymentType` field, but Acuity uses `processor`  
**Solution**: Check `processor` first, then fallback to other fields  
**Result**: Cash payments correctly identified

```python
# Before
payment_method = payment.get("paymentType") or payment.get("paymentMethod") or "appointment"

# After  
payment_method = payment.get("processor") or payment.get("paymentType") or payment.get("paymentMethod") or "appointment"
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
**Added comprehensive logging for:**
- Unmatched appointments (first 10 examples with details)
- Payment collection results (success/failure per appointment)
- Pagination boundaries and termination reasons
- Contact matching statistics per page

**Log Examples:**
```
[acuity] SKIP_UNMATCHED: aid=1549284919, service=TUESDAY SILK PRESS SPECIAL, email=..., phone=..., clientID=...
[acuity] PAYMENT_COLLECTED: aid=1547916860, payments=2, txns_created=2, txns_skipped=0
[acuity] PAGINATION_END: Last page reached (fetched 50 < limit 100), total_pages=3, total_appointments=95
```

## Testing Results

### Week Test (Oct 15-22)
✅ **SUCCESS**
- Appointments imported: 35
- Transactions created: 44
- Revenue: +$3,349
- Job completed: YES (no hanging)
- Duration: ~30 seconds

### Full October Test
⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**
- Appointments imported: 95 (41%)
- Transactions created: 72 (54%)
- Revenue: $4,826 (44%)
- Job completed: YES (no hanging)
- Duration: ~5.5 minutes

## Root Cause Analysis

### What's Working
1. ✅ Payment API access - Cash, Stripe, PayPal all returning correctly
2. ✅ Contact rollup - No more hanging, batched updates successful
3. ✅ Payment method identification - Cash properly labeled
4. ✅ Transaction creation - Idempotent inserts working
5. ✅ Contact matching - Email/phone/client ID lookups functional

### Remaining Issues

#### Issue 1: Missing 135 Appointments
**Hypothesis**: Early pagination termination or date filtering  
**Evidence**: 
- Acuity API returns 230 October appointments with `minDate=2025-10-01&max=2000`
- Our DB only has 95 October appointments
- Missing appointments confirmed to exist in Acuity (tested samples: 1549284919, 1549284684)

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Historical filter** (line 865): `if not allow_historical and start_ts < now_ts`
   - With `allow_historical=True`, this should be disabled
   - But may have logic issues with future appointments

2. **Contact matching failures**: 20 appointments skipped as "unmatched"
   - But this only accounts for 20, not 135 missing

3. **Early pagination exit** (line 1063):
   ```python
   if not allow_historical and inserts_this_page == 0 and appt_pages > 0:
       print(f"[acuity] appointments_up_to_date: All future appointments exist, stopping import after page {appt_pages}")
       break
   ```
   - This could terminate early if a page has zero new inserts (all duplicates)
   - Needs investigation via Render logs

4. **Max pages limit** (line 808): `if appt_pages >= 20`
   - Safety guard may be too restrictive
   - 20 pages × 100 limit = 2,000 appointments max
   - Should be sufficient for 230, but worth checking

#### Issue 2: Missing ~60 Transactions from Imported Appointments
- Have 95 appointments but only 72 transactions
- Expected ~106 paid appointments (from Acuity)
- Suggests payment collection not happening for all appointments

**Hypothesis**: Unpaid future appointments
- Many October appointments haven't occurred yet (Oct 23-31)
- These wouldn't have payments in Acuity yet
- This may be expected behavior

## Next Steps for Complete Fix

### Immediate (Review Render Logs)
1. **Check pagination logs** to see where import stopped
   - Look for `PAGINATION_END` messages
   - Check `appointments_up_to_date` early exits
   - Verify total pages and appointments processed

2. **Review unmatched appointment logs**
   - Look for `SKIP_UNMATCHED` entries
   - Identify contact matching patterns
   - Check if email/phone normalization issues

3. **Analyze payment collection logs**
   - Count `PAYMENT_COLLECTED` vs `NO_PAYMENTS`
   - Verify payments checked matches appointments imported

### Code Fixes (If Needed After Log Review)

**If pagination terminates early:**
```python
# Remove or adjust early exit logic (line 1063)
# May need to check if we're at the true end of data vs just a page of duplicates
```

**If contact matching is the issue:**
```python
# Improve email normalization (already lowercase)
# Add more phone format variations
# Consider creating contacts on-the-fly for unmatched appointments
```

**If max pages is the issue:**
```python
# Increase from 20 to 50 or remove limit entirely
if appt_pages >= 50:  # Was 20
```

### Alternative Approach: Date-Range Chunking
Instead of single large backfill, run multiple smaller ones:
```bash
# Week 1
curl -X POST ".../backfill?since=2025-10-01&until=2025-10-07"
# Week 2  
curl -X POST ".../backfill?since=2025-10-08&until=2025-10-14"
# Week 3
curl -X POST ".../backfill?since=2025-10-15&until=2025-10-21"
# Week 4
curl -X POST ".../backfill?since=2025-10-22&until=2025-10-31"
```

This approach:
- Reduces per-job data volume
- Easier to diagnose specific date failures
- Lower risk of timeouts
- Can run in parallel

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Next Hour)
1. Review Render logs for the full October backfill job (`ca20b0c7-bd29-4190-b74a-dd46b272dedd`)
2. Identify why only 95/230 appointments imported
3. Determine if gap is due to pagination, matching, or expected behavior (unpaid future appointments)

### Medium Term (Next Day)
1. If pagination issue found: Fix and re-run
2. If matching issue found: Improve normalization or create contacts on-fly
3. Consider date-chunked approach for more granular control

### Long Term (Production)
1. Implement daily incremental sync instead of large backfills
2. Add monitoring alerts for low capture rates
3. Create dashboard showing appointments vs transactions ratio
4. Set up automated reconciliation with Acuity reports

## Conclusion

Made **significant progress** - 14x revenue increase and 10x transaction increase. Core issues fixed:
- ✅ Job hanging resolved
- ✅ Cash payments working
- ✅ Contact rollups successful

**44% of October revenue now captured** (up from 3%), but **56% gap remains**. Root cause investigation via Render logs needed to determine if remaining gap is:
- Technical issue (pagination/matching)
- Expected behavior (future unpaid appointments)
- Data quality issue (missing Acuity records)

**Ready for log review and next iteration of fixes.**
